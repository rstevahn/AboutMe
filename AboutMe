I'm an old programmer getting back in the game after a 12-year hiatus. 
I have 25 years of experience, primarily in firmware and systems software. 
I spent 18 years with HP, working on LaserJets, Web Printing (I am one of the authors of the CSS2 specification) and device drivers. 
I'm currently pursuing the Treehouse Full Stack Web Developer TechDegree, which I expect to complete in about 10 weeks. Let's see how I do!
I also plan on learning Swift and Python in my spare time. 
Once I finish freshening my skills, I hope to freelance until it's time for me to retire.
